# ENCS5344 Spoken Language Processing SFS Assignment

This repository hosts materials related to the Spoken Language Processing assignment for the Spring 2024 semester at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, focusing on practical experience with the Speech Filing Systems (SFS) software.

## Assignment Overview

Students will analyze and manipulate sound files using SFS to understand various aspects of spoken language processing. This assignment is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects such as spectrogram analysis, digital filtering, and speech synthesis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SFS software: Download from [here](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/sfs/download.php).
- A working microphone and headphones to record and test sounds.

### Setup

1. **Install SFS:** Follow the installation guide on the official website to set up the Speech Filing Systems software.
2. **Check Audio Hardware:** Use SFS to verify that your microphone and headphones are functioning correctly.


## Tasks and Deliverables

Each part of the assignment involves specific tasks related to the processing and analysis of sound files:

1. **Spectrogram Analysis:** Explore the bandwidth and spectrogram of different sounds.
2. **Filter Design:** Implement and analyze FIR digital filters using MATLAB.
3. **Speech Analysis:** Use formant analysis to study vowel sounds and speech synthesis.
4. **Concatenative Synthesis:** Experiment with sub-word level concatenation to synthesize new words.
5. **Formant Synthesis:** Generate speech using synthetic formant patterns.
